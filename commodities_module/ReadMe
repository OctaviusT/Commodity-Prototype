# Commodities Module

This module provides scripts for collecting, storing, and analyzing commodity
market data. It forms the data backbone of the Commodity Prototype project.

## Purpose
The commodities module handles raw market information such as prices,
volumes, and regional trade flows. The goal is to create a clean and
query-ready dataset for integration with other modules, such as the
Finance Module.

## Structure
- `commodity_script.py` â†’ Example script that pulls and processes commodity data.
- (future) Additional scripts for importing regional commodity prices,
  managing historical data, and integrating with external APIs.

## Next Steps
- Expand scripts to include multiple commodities and regional datasets.
- Build export functions to move processed data into Power BI or Excel.
- Create links to the Finance Module for combined analytics workflows.
