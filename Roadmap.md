📌 Project Roadmap

This repository is being developed into a portfolio project focused on applied data science for commodities, logistics, and forecasting. Below is the planned roadmap of features and side projects to showcase breadth and depth.

🎯 Phase 1 – Foundation

    🗂️ Restructure repository (data/, src/, notebooks/, docs/).

    ⚙️ Add reproducible environment (requirements.txt, environment.yml).

    📖 Document setup and usage instructions.

    🔎 Add tests for data loaders and ETL functions.

🌾 Phase 2 – Commodity Dashboard (Flagship Project)

    📊 Build live charts for commodity prices (candlesticks, moving averages).

    ⛽ Integrate fuel and logistics cost datasets.

    🗄️ Store historical price pulls in a small database (SQLite/Postgres).

    🔮 Add short-term forecasting model (Prophet, ARIMA, or XGBoost).

    🖥️ Create a simple Streamlit dashboard for visualization.

🚚 Phase 3 – Supply Chain & Risk Modeling

    🌦️ Integrate external disruption data (weather, USDA, trucking stats).

    ⚡ Build a risk scoring model to show cost impacts.

    🗺️ Visualize results with risk heatmaps.

📰 Phase 4 – Market News & Sentiment

    🕵️ Scrape financial/commodity news headlines.

    🧠 Apply pretrained sentiment model (FinBERT or equivalent).

    📈 Compare sentiment signals with commodity price moves.

🗺️ Phase 5 – Geospatial Agriculture Project

    🌱 Pull USDA crop yield or soil datasets for Virginia.

    🛰️ Add satellite or remote sensing overlays.

    🗺️ Build interactive maps (GeoPandas + Folium).

🔢 Phase 6 – Optimization & Forecasting Models

    🚛 Apply linear programming to trucking/logistics routing.

    🧮 Compare forecasting models (Prophet, ARIMA, LSTM, Gradient Boost).

    🧾 Develop a reusable time-series forecasting pipeline.

💼 Phase 7 – Finance/Accounting Side Project

    📂 Upload CSV invoices or receipts.

    ✍️ Auto-categorize with NLP and rule-based logic.
  
    📊 Summarize in dashboards (Power BI, Streamlit).

✅ Deliverables for Portfolio

    Clean, reproducible code.

    Multiple notebooks demonstrating methodology.

    At least one deployable app/dashboard.

    📘 Clear documentation + diagrams (ERDs, data flow, roadmap).
